The "run_analysis.R" script returns dataset presenting average means and standard deviations of 79 various 3-axial acceleration and velocity measurements obtained in an wearable computing experiment performed by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio and Luca Oneto; the average means and standard deviations are obtained from multiple samples and are provided for each of 6 activities and each of 30 subjects separately.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

A full description of the original study can be obtained here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The initial dataset processed in the current analysis consisted of:
- Two data frames containing a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables for each record. One of the data frames contained the train data and the second one contained test data.
- Two vectors of identifiers of the subject who carried out the experiment - the train vector and the test vector.
- A vector of activity labels (they were the same for the train and test data)


The original dataset included the following files, pertinent to the current analysis:
=====================================================================================

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all variables.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training activity labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test activity labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

Notes: 
======
- Features were normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector was a row on the text file.

How the current dataset was obtained:
=====================================
1. The dataset was downloaded and extracted.

2. The elements of dataset were read into memory and saved in variables.

3. Two data frames (a train data frame and test data frame) were created by merging the 561-feature vectors of diverse 3-axial acceleration and velocity measures with a column (vector) identifying each of 6 activities performed and a column (vector) identifying each of the 30 subjects.

4. Using "gdata" library, a data frame was created by merging the train and test datasets. A "source" variable was created to record the source of each record (train data or test data). The source variable were moved to the first column.

5. A list of variable names was enlarged to include names for the 3 unnamed columns in the newly created merged dataset.

6. The list of variable names was applied to the dataset.

7. A new dataset was created by subsetting 79 variables containing means and standard deviations of multiple repeated measurements. The variables for selection were extracted with regular expressions identifying character strings: "mean" and "std". The dataset contained also 3 id-variables, one identifying the source dataset, the second identifying the subject and the last one identifying the type of activity.

8. Integer-coded activity identifiers were replaced by descriptive labels extracted from an activity labels file.

9. The initial variable names were expanded using a series of regular expressions to obtain better descriptivity and readability.

10. Using the "reshape2" library, the dataset was melted to represent all the 79 mean and standard deviation variables vertically and the identifier variables horizontally.

11. The final data frame were created by melting to create a new tidy dataset containing the average of each mean and standard deviation variable for each activity and each subject. The averages were obtained by averaging multiple measurements obtained by individual subjects.

The final dataset contains the following variables:
===================================================

identifies one of 6 recorded types of activities: "laying", "sitting", "standing", "walking", "walkingdownstairs", "walkingupstairs"
