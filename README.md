This repo contains the following files:
=======================================
- "README.md" - provides basic information about the original study, for which the current analysis was performed and about the files in the current repository
- "run_analysis.R" - a code that returns dataset presenting average means and standard deviations of various 3-axial acceleration and velocity parameters obtained in an wearable computing experiment performed by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio and Luca Oneto (more details below); the average means and standard deviations are obtained from multiple samples and are provided for each of 6 activities and each of 30 subjects separately
- "CodeBook.md" - shows information about the variables contained in the datased generated by the "run_analysis.R" script

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.
